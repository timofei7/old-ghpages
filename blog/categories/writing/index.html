<h1><a href="/blog/2010/06/08/a-paper-the-neural-mechanisms-and-purposes-of-randomness-in-consciousness/">a paper: The Neural Mechanisms and Purposes of Randomness in Consciousness</a></h1>

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content"><p>Do you believe in free will or determinism?   Either way,  imagine you are
creating a life form, and that you want it to have free will.  You figure out
that you need to design an organ that would be responsible for this.  You
decide to call it the "free willer".</p>

<p>What would this organ do? You realize that it must make decisions, as that is
what "will" allows you to do.  But how will it do so?  You realize that
learning is involved -- that this organ needs to take into consideration past
events. Oops, you have just created the deterministic willer!</p>

<p>Ok ok, let's back up a minute.  If we don't take into consideration past
events... well then the decisions it would make would have to be random.  Is
that what we want? Not really, random decisions won't get this new life form
very far!</p>

<p>What other decision mechanisms could we come up with for this organ?  Well it
could be influenced by some predetermined set of rules or genes that get
better over time, but that's just another determinism!</p>

<p>Ideally what we want is something that is influenced by past events
(learning). Something that can improve its programming over generations
(genes). And finally something that can decide to do OTHER than its
deterministic inputs dictate (the free part).</p>

<p>Turns out that the brain marries randomness with learning and genes in a
perfect way to achieve just this!  We already have an organ that will
purposefully introduce randomness into our thinking process so that we can
come up with unique solutions and choices that are not predetermined by the
universe or by our genes and past experiences (at least not exclusively).</p>

<p>Here's a paper I wrote about this that goes into this in more detail.  The
brain is sooo cool.</p>

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Flow, Education, and Ritalin</strong><br/>
My eyes are glued to the screen. They rarely blink. They become irritated but
I do not notice. I am in the zone. The force is with me. I feel it flow
through me. I am coding. Even though the coding paradigm may not apply to
everyone, we all know that feeling of hyper-attention. When an activity is so
engrossing that the rest of the world fades away, we are left mano-a-mano,
tête-à-tête, our ego and the task battling together for mutual gain.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/28/a-moment-in-the-life-of-camus-sisyphus/">A Moment in the Life of Camus' Sisyphus</a></h1>

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content"><p>I watch my cursed boulder tumble down my mountain. I heave a sigh of relief;
my aching muscles allowed a brief respite. As I stand on its majestic craggy
peak, I survey my mountain beneath me. My boulder is now far out of sight, but
I can feel it down below in the darkness waiting for me. I send my thoughts
out to it -- my boulder you are my work, my affliction, my friend and my
enemy. I shall see you soon enough. In these seemingly countless days,
logically countable but practically indistinguishable, my mind is not always
so clear. At this instant I am aware -- tomorrow I may not be. I grasp the
moment, tenderly. Let me slow it down and take joy in my thoughts. Before my
curse -- I can barely remember -- I took my thoughts for granted. Mortal, I
had a limited amount of time for thoughts, yet I did not enjoy them. Immortal,
and now each thought is precious -- I have forever and thus have infinite
thoughts, yet I take joy in each, insignificant as it is. The absurdity
continues, the one constant along with my rock and my mountain to keep me
company. Yet as I stand there, the cold rare mountain air turning my breath
visible, I am happy.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/01/10/fear-happiness/">fear, happiness</a></h1>

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content"><p>What is the mind when it is happy and when it is unhappy? Most likely the
answer is different for each person, but to understand it for myself I first
need to discern when it is that I am happy. When I think about happiness the
first concept that comes to mind is friendship. I have always heard people say
that in college you make friends for life. The kind of friends that will be
with you your whole life and will stick by you through everything. I never
believed them. A lot of my friends are part-time, we sometimes keep in touch,
mostly through the noncommittal medium of facebook. More recently however, I
managed to make some friends who I feel I could call lifelong. I have always
been slightly afraid of people, and social situations are often uncomfortable
for me, yet I have unfailingly been drawn to take project classes. This seemed
uncharacteristic for me until I realized that the times I feel most
comfortable with someone are when there is a common external goal that we
share. C.S. Lewis thought that true friendship, which he categorized as the
love called philia, could only exist between people who share a common vision
or activity. He claimed that because this was the least biologically necessary
love, when it truly existed, it was the most admirable. He lauds friendship
and says, "To the Ancients, Friendship [notice the capitalization] seemed the
happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life…"<sup>1</sup> Through
friends that I made over many shared hours in computer labs I now see more
clearly what he meant. Lewis's various categories become blurry at this point
yet the importance he places on shared interest remains.</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/2010/01/03/conscious-evolution/">Conscious Evolution: the possibilities of technology+education</a></h1>

<!-- figure out how to include excerpt here-->
<div class="entry-content"><p>Is it possible for humanity to consciously direct our own evolution and if so
can we evolve to be better, smarter and faster? Can we evolve ourselves to be
able to sustain an utopic society? In my intro to psychology class one of the
professors told the following story. A professor experimented on his own
newborn by reading Greek poetry to him. He read the same couple of paragraphs
to him every day until the infant was six months old and then stopped. When
the boy turned ten his father started having him memorize Greek passages. He
counted how many repetitions the boy would need to fully memorize a passage
and found that those paragraphs that the boy had previously been exposed as an
infant required half the repetitions that the new passages took. This story is
anecdotal and would require a better designed longitudinal study to prove,
however it was inspirational for me and one of many such stories in that class
that convinced me to change my major from computer science to cognitive
science. I learned in that class that if we utilize the power of our learning
brains, the possibilities for achievement both individually and as a society
could be endless. I became fascinated with the question of how we can harness
our learning, and specifically how technological solutions could be combined
with cognitive science research to take learning to new levels.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>They are afraid -- the great firewall of China, the blocking of Facebook in
Pakistan, Bangladesh and others, Iran’s blocking of foreign media and the
eventual temporary internet and text message blackout following 2009
presidential elections (Zuckerman, 2010), these are just a few instances of
how powerful social and citizen media have become and how governments are
attempting to cope with the loss of informational control. In countries where
the press is tightly controlled, citizens, and often foreign media as well,
turn to various self-reporting outlets such as Twitter, Indymedia, YouTube and
other blogging sites. These social media networks allow not only information
to disperse across borders with unprecedented ease (such as the case of Iran’s
bloggers) but also allows cross-scale interaction between transnational actors
and local, previously out-of-sight groups (such as the Mexican Zapatistas)
(Dodds,K., 2007). It has become common to see Twitter and YouTube posts
referenced on various American news outlets as part of their main news
segments (Zuckerman, 2010).</p>
