(Gunkless SolidWorks Design: Tim Tregubov,  Spring 2010)

For the "flagship" engineering class my group, Divya Gunasekaran, Elizabeth Klinger, Alannah Linkhorn, Pavel Sotskov, and myself, designed and built a self-cleaning drain. It was a small device that would retrofit in your shower drain and was foot powered to help clear clogged drains.  By the end of the course we had a working, tested prototype.

My goals for the class on the outset were: to learn some machining and SolidWorks --- basically an engineering experience outside of electronics and computer engineering.  That happened, along with some fun design stuff and a lot of report writing and gantt charting.  
 
My contributions to the project were:

* SolidWorks design
* rapid prototyping (Object Eden)
* some lathe and milling machining work
