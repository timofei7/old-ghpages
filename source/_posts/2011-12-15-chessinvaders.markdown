The current project I am working on is an iPad game that teaches basic rules of chess in a fast paced not-quite-chess environment. The game is a small, but fun combination of space invaders and chess.  It teaches and drills the basic movement rules while remaining engaging.

A recentish clip of the 3D environment with touch zoom and pan:

And this is an intro sequence test, most of this will change, but the pink screen UI I think is here to stay!

Here are some simple 2D graphicsI designed for a pseudo 2D mode where the animals are billboarded to face the camera. This is a bit cuter and better for kids than the current static 3D models. Ideally the pieces will be 3D and animated but for now this will be the cute mode. 

<div id="animalsgalleria"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
jQuery('#animalsgalleria').galleria({
debug: false,
_toggleInfo: false,
width: 400,
picasa: 'useralbum:timofei/2DChessGraphics',
picasaOptions: {
        description: true,
}
});
</script>
