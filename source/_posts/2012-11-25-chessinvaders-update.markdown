Been too busy to post updates, but finally making progress on chessInvaders again.  An alpha version of the game was shown at a [Digital Arts Showcase](http://now.dartmouth.edu/2012/05/dartmouth-digital-arts-students-work-showcased-in-downtown-hanover/) and was a great success.  One kid couldn't put it down and played for half an hour straight refusing to let anybody else try.  I was able to get some positive feedback and am now planning on releasing it for the Christmas season (if it gets through the App Store approval in time).
