This was an awesome summer. I lived in a van and spent two nights+ a week in the drawing studio.  Unfortunately most of these photos were taken with a phone camera and so the quality is not that great. I've given most of them away so no chance of retaking. There were lots more but the photos were simply too blurry.

When I was a kid I used to love drawing, but by puberty I had exchanged it for computer games and model airplanes.  When I took drawing in college it was like I was a kid again.  This was another one of those fulfilling classes by the end of which I was confident that given some charcoal and paper and time I could create an aesthetically unoffensive and even possibly recognizable likeness of anything.
