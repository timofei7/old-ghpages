  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a <a href="blog/2012/04/26/unity-singletons/">previous post</a> about singletons in <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity3D</a> and have since added a useful functionality to that class.  One of the useful features of a singleton is that it is self instantiating.  As a MonoBehaviour in Unity you may have a class that has serializable public variables available within the Unity editor to allow easy tweaking of variables / for artists to modify / to hook up to other Unity compenents easily. Additionally you are probably using <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Prefabs.html">prefabs</a> to manage game components in your scenes.</p>

<p>What I wanted to have was a prefab with a singleton on it that I could dump in the Resources folder and have it be self-loading.  Just as singletons allow for really nice static access methods, this would allow me to really easily organize my project as a bunch of prefabs and when a level needed a particular component it would just use it, no need to instantiate and keep a reference within some big main class, nor keep it in the scene heirarchy at all to begin with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Been too busy to post updates, but finally making progress on chessInvaders again.  An alpha version of the game was shown at a <a href="http://now.dartmouth.edu/2012/05/dartmouth-digital-arts-students-work-showcased-in-downtown-hanover/">Digital Arts Showcase</a> and was a great success.  One kid couldn&#8217;t put it down and played for half an hour straight refusing to let anybody else try.  I was able to get some positive feedback and am now planning on releasing it for the Christmas season (if it gets through the App Store approval in time).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity3D</a> having a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton</a> class is very useful, whether for &#8220;global&#8221; state or simply for the convenience of having a static accessor so you don&#8217;t have to have lots of: <code>FindObjectOfType(typeof(Builder)) as Builder;</code></p>

<p>So you code up a C# singleton and then realize that you actually need it to be a <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html">MonoBehavior</a>, not just a <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html">ScriptableObject</a> &#8211; say you want the singleton to run <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/index.Coroutines_26_Yield.html">coroutines</a>, or have a transform, or any other MonoBehavior feature.  But monobehaviors <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html">can&#8217;t</a> be initialized with a constructor.</p>

<p>So what you want is a monobehavior pseudo singleton pattern.  The unity community wiki has some <a href="http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=Singleton">good info</a>
 about the various options but all require boilerplate.</p>

<p>So I wrote a parametrized generic pseudo singleton monobehavior class.  I attempted to compile all the best advice out there, so it is threadsafe, has some extra stuff for setting a parent, doesn&#8217;t implement an Awake, and initializes lazily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over a couple of weekends, mostly as an exercise in learning a new language / framework two friends of mine and I came up with: <a href="http://udunnit-frontend-dev.herokuapp.com">demo.udunit.com</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell it is:<br/>
UdunIt (pronounced you-done-it, as in whodunit): A fun way to share, boast about and track your progress towards major life accomplishments, as well as discover new ones to take on! People love grouping things into lists &#8211; it&#8217;s a natural human tendency: The Four-thousand Foot Mountains of New Hampshire, California Micro-brews, Best Restaurants in Austin, TX. We want to motivate people to take on these challenges, to get out and do something. Udunit will bring social and gaming aspects to these accomplishment lists, building on people’s desire to share their accomplishments as well as their competitive natures.</p>

<p>Based on Foursquare&#8217;s <a href="http://engineering.foursquare.com">engineering blog</a> (which has lots of good technical information about how they do things) we decided to give <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a> a try and learn <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> along the way!  Did we like it?  Yes and no. I am intellectually attracted to functional programming and enjoyed Scala in that regard. However, the type system gave us some headaches (seems to be a common comment), and we found that in general there was a tendency in the community toward less than readable code. Lift&#8217;s documentation left a lot to be desired and was often behind the current &#8220;best&#8221; way of doing things.</p>

<p>It was fun+frustrating to play with and our next project won&#8217;t be using Lift/Scala,   but I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://www.opalang.com">Opa</a> and am excited to try that for a project!</p>

<p>Feel free to check out <a href="http://udunnit-frontend-dev.herokuapp.com">UdunIt</a> and use it!  The basic funcionality is there, and I&#8217;ll leave it up in case it suddenly starts getting popular. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you believe in free will or determinism?   Either way,  imagine you are
creating a life form, and that you want it to have free will.  You figure out
that you need to design an organ that would be responsible for this.  You
decide to call it the &#8220;free willer&#8221;.</p>

<p>What would this organ do? You realize that it must make decisions, as that is
what &#8220;will&#8221; allows you to do.  But how will it do so?  You realize that
learning is involved &#8211; that this organ needs to take into consideration past
events. Oops, you have just created the deterministic willer!</p>

<p>Ok ok, let&#8217;s back up a minute.  If we don&#8217;t take into consideration past
events&#8230; well then the decisions it would make would have to be random.  Is
that what we want? Not really, random decisions won&#8217;t get this new life form
very far!</p>

<p>What other decision mechanisms could we come up with for this organ?  Well it
could be influenced by some predetermined set of rules or genes that get
better over time, but that&#8217;s just another determinism!</p>

<p>Ideally what we want is something that is influenced by past events
(learning). Something that can improve its programming over generations
(genes). And finally something that can decide to do OTHER than its
deterministic inputs dictate (the free part).</p>

<p>Turns out that the brain marries randomness with learning and genes in a
perfect way to achieve just this!  We already have an organ that will
purposefully introduce randomness into our thinking process so that we can
come up with unique solutions and choices that are not predetermined by the
universe or by our genes and past experiences (at least not exclusively).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a paper I wrote about this that goes into this in more detail.  The
brain is sooo cool.</p>

<p>(Gunkless SolidWorks Design: Tim Tregubov,  Spring 2010)</p>

<p>For the &#8220;flagship&#8221; engineering class my group, Divya Gunasekaran, Elizabeth Klinger, Alannah Linkhorn, Pavel Sotskov, and myself, designed and built a self-cleaning drain. It was a small device that would retrofit in your shower drain and was foot powered to help clear clogged drains.  By the end of the course we had a working, tested prototype.</p>

My eyes are glued to the screen. They rarely blink. They become irritated but
I do not notice. I am in the zone. The force is with me. I feel it flow
through me. I am coding. Even though the coding paradigm may not apply to
everyone, we all know that feeling of hyper-attention. When an activity is so
engrossing that the rest of the world fades away, we are left mano-a-mano,
tête-à-tête, our ego and the task battling together for mutual gain.</p>
