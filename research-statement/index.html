<blockquote><p>“To be playful and serious at the same time is possible,
and it defines the ideal mental condition [for learning]”
  &#8211; John Dewey, 1910</p></blockquote>

<h2>Reasons and Objectives:</h2>

<p>In second grade, we often had &#8220;mad minute&#8221; math tests. I practiced flash cards day and night, until one day I felt I was ready. I completed all the questions and got them right, but I wrote all of my 5’s backwards (completely normal developmentally for a seven year old), so the teacher marked them all wrong and my math spirit was crushed. My teachers were, quite honestly, terrible, inducing fear in the students through performance pressure and boring teaching &#8211; and so I had a math phobia in grade school. Almost since that moment I have wanted to solve the problem of bad education. It is possible to have fun with math without the pressure and struggle. However, mindlessly applying a game paradigm, such as in the pedagogically poor yet classic Math Blaster (which my parents gave me around that same time) is not the solution &#8211; the methodology is what counts.</p>

<p>My niece, at age three, was addicted to <a href="http://www.starfall.com">starfall.com</a>. She would spend hours on the educational game site learning the alphabet, counting, and vocabulary &#8211; all without any pressure from her parents and before entering pre-school. She would rather play alphabet games on starfall than play with her toys. Learning was the game. Every evening her mantra was, &#8220;Can I go work on starfall now?&#8221; That a three year old was so interested in the animated colorful world of a computer game comes as no surprise. However, her pure enjoyment of learning in this setting demonstrates the remarkable potency of technology as a learning tool.</p>

<p>I briefly worked with an educational consulting non-profit that does work in Ghana. One of the biggest problems the organization faces is finding and training good teachers. The director told me that if he could, he would love to replace the teachers with iPods and let the students teach themselves. Though that solution may be extreme, it highlights the problems with the current system, in which a typical lesson plan consists of rote memorization during which the teacher copies the only textbook &#8211; line by line &#8211; onto the board.</p>

<p>I believe that implicit learning can be formally utilized for far more than it is currently. Learning should never be hard or tedious or rote. It is not only possible but also natural for the brain to simply, continuously, and joyfully learn. The human mind is an amazing learning machine, and given the right inputs the learning process can be optimized. We are starting to recognize some of the things that are critical to good learning, such as immediate feedback, obtainable goals, continuous challenge, and a positive environment. All too often education, particularly in underserved populations, does not exhibit these features.</p>

<p>Can you imagine an educational setting where the material is custom tailored to each student&#8217;s ability; in which the student, excited to learn, can engage with the material fully and attentively; and where the learning process is so tuned to the human brain that the student feels &#8220;in the zone&#8221; and practically addicted to learning rather than frustrated and intimidated?  There is no need for this type of education to be left to the imagination. Appropriate scaffolding and discovery play can turn learning an impenetrable topic into a game at which the brain inherently excels. The brain can become addicted to learning as easily as to gaming given appropriate design and rewards structures. Technology can and should play an essential role in education &#8211; especially when the lone teacher cannot meet the needs of the many students.
(more <a href="http://www.zingweb.com/blog/2010/03/11/flow-and-education">here</a>)</p>

<p>My goal is to research and build teaching tools that are attuned to the ways in which the brain actually learns. For instance, from a software development standpoint, there are libraries to help the developer with projects ranging from web frameworks to neural networks. However, there is no toolkit that would encode optimal human learning behavior. Such a toolkit would provide a concrete framework for building software that is human learning algorithm aware. This system would enable developers to have a model of optimal human learning patterns readily available rather than having to do the research from scratch or through trial and error. Additionally, it could improve its algorithms through machine learning and analytics to further optimize each players experience and the original educational theories. For instance, the concept of spaced repetition could be useful not only in flashcard or language learning applications, but also anywhere new content is being introduced, and it can be harnessed simply by hooking into this library. Any app linked to this platform would instantly be targeted to the individual. If a particular player had slightly different optimal repetition intervals, the software would adjust them. Such a system would make it easier to design more sophisticated and better performing educational applications. Additionally, the same principles that enable enjoyable progressive learning are also behind addictive gameplay in general. This allows the platform to have wide appeal not only to strictly educational games, but also to any technology that has an addictive/learning component. This is an example of a research item that I would be interested in pursuing.</p>

<p>Human advancement and the betterment of human life rely on the progress of learning. We need to educate more and educate better, and what better way than through play.</p>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>My college career started in a psych class with a story about how reading Greek passages to an infant can influence how quickly they are able to memorize those passages 10 years later. I was inspired by this, and by other studies about the wonder that is the brain, so I changed course slightly from computers to cognition. I took education classes to learn about the problems in educational systems, child development and cognition to learn how the brain learns and solves problems, and engineering and computer science to learn how to leverage technology to implement solutions.</p>

<p>My work experience includes working at a tech company straight out of high school (as a coder) and working full-time (as a sysadmin) throughout college. I have been a student, a system administrator, and a craftsman (serially and in parallel). My education and technical background grant me a unique perspective, a passion for making things, the capability and mental flexibility to learn on the job, and a knack for solving problems in practical ways. My interests and skills are perhaps best expressed through the various projects I have worked on. You can see my CV and videos, demos, and descriptions of my projects at <a href="http://www.zingweb.com">http://www.zingweb.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Media Lab and Conclusion:</h2>

<p>A few days ago a friend with whom I am working on a project told me, &#8220;You&#8217;re fun because you get all excited about the smallest things sometimes (in a great way). Your excitement is contagious.&#8221; This is my best feature. In college the classes I loved and excelled at were the project classes. This is why I believe I will be a good fit at MIT Media Lab. The specific focus of the Media Lab on creating actual working technology sets the Media Lab apart and greatly appeals to my builder/problem-solver attitude. Not only would I be happy working with such smart people on projects that I find worthwhile, but I know that I, in turn, would be a useful contributor. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Lifelong Kindergarten:</strong> Your goals are very close to my heart, as you can see most of this essay has been about education and play. I am beginning to introduce Scratch to my niece. It is a pair programming exercise at the moment, but it is a joy to see her delight at creating. I believe strongly that life is all about playful learning and creating, and your projects mesh directly with my interests. When I was a kid, before I learned Basic, I tried to use a sprite based create-a-game engine, and was frustrated by it. Now, with Scratch and other such tools, much more is accessible and possible, but education still struggles. I want to work to make playful learning ubiquitous, with toolset projects such as the one I mentioned previously and with play environments that enable learning so compelling that you forget that it is good for you.</p>

<p><strong>High-Low Tech:</strong>  Democratizing engineering is something I firmly believe in. I have worked on a small project with the lilypad: a sleeping mask that would wake you up with lights (thank you for helping to make it possible for anybody to create their own technology). Another project I worked on, TiNZ (a modern reinvention of tiltmaze), is also enabled by this movement (thank you SparkFun). The availability and accessibility of the tools and knowledge for creation is an amazing modern development. I want to work to further enable kids to become engaged with technological creation, to make learning technology a physical explorative experience.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Interfaces:</strong>  The GreenLite Dartmouth project I worked on shared some of your goals: providing intuitive and easy access to information that would influence our everyday lives. This is the same goal behind an idea I had to reinvent chess with physical pieces that light up and allow a child to use explorative play to learn the game (I am now implementing part of this as an iPad game). For the Ghana non-profit I mentioned earlier, I had proposed a project to provide a collaborative game-like environment, which, through texting and voice message on non-smart phones, would help connect the students lives better with their studies. I want to work to implement intuitive interfaces for learning situations (like the Sensei Project), enabling younger audiences to interact easily with learning materials, helping to connect abstract concepts to the physical world.</p>
